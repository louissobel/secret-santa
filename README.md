Secret Santa Scripts
===================

 - example/Makefile is documentation of steps
 - if you're using gmail, you should change some constants in `emailer.rb`
 - if not gmail, you might have to edit emailer further
 - `emailer.rb` has some ruby dependencies:
    - mail (for mail)
    - colorize (for colors)
 - then there's a dependency on [graphviz](http://www.graphviz.org/) for the graph picture
